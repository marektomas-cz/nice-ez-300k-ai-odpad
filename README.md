## Installation

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.1+

- Deno 1.40+ (for script execution runtime)
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend build)
- npm or yarn (package manager)
- Prometheus (for metrics collection)
- Grafana (for metrics visualization)

### Quick Start (Development)
```bash
# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Run migrations and seed demo data
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed --class=ScriptingSeeder

# Build frontend assets
npm run dev

# Start development server
php artisan serve
```

### Docker Development Setup
```bash
# Build and start containers
docker-compose up -d

# Install dependencies
docker-compose exec app composer install
docker-compose exec app npm install

# Build frontend assets
docker-compose exec app npm run build

```

### Production Setup
See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete production deployment instructions.

## Configuration

Configure the scripting environment in `config/scripting.php`:

```php
'execution' => [
    'timeout' => 30,        // Max execution time in seconds
    'memory_limit' => 32,   // Max memory in MB
    'rate_limit' => 100,    // Requests per minute
],
```

## Deno Sidecar Architecture

The solution now uses a secure Deno sidecar for script execution, replacing the previous V8Js integration:

### Architecture Benefits
- **Security Isolation**: Scripts run in separate containers with resource limits
- **Resource Control**: CPU and memory constraints prevent resource exhaustion
- **Modern Runtime**: TypeScript/JavaScript execution with Deno's secure-by-default approach
- **HTTP Communication**: Clean API between Laravel and Deno executor
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of execution environment

### Deno Executor Features
- **Sandboxed Execution**: No file system or network access by default
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable memory and CPU constraints with cgroups enforcement
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and metrics
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and timeout management
- **Security**: Runs as non-root user with minimal privileges
- **Watchdog Integration**: Real-time monitoring and automatic termination of runaway scripts
- **Kill-Switch Support**: Emergency shutdown mechanism for security breaches

### Script Execution Flow
1. **Request**: Laravel receives script execution request
2. **Security Analysis**: AST-based security validation with whitelist/blacklist patterns
3. **Watchdog Initialization**: Real-time monitoring setup with resource limits
4. **Sidecar Communication**: HTTP request to Deno executor with security context
5. **Execution**: Secure script execution in Deno runtime with isolation
6. **Monitoring**: Continuous resource monitoring and violation detection
7. **Response**: Results returned to Laravel application
8. **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics collection and alerting

## Usage

### Creating Scripts

```javascript
// Example client script
const result = api.database.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = ?', [true]);
const users = JSON.parse(result);

users.forEach(user => {
    if (user.last_login < Date.now() - 86400000) {
        api.events.dispatch('user.inactive', { user_id: user.id });
    }
});

return { processed: users.length };
```

### Execution Triggers

- **Manual**: Via web interface or API
- **Event-driven**: Laravel event listeners
- **Scheduled**: Cron jobs and queued tasks
- **Sidecar Execution**: Secure execution via Deno container

## Script Versioning

The solution includes comprehensive version control for scripts with enhanced workflow features:

### Version Management
- **Semantic Versioning**: Automatic version numbering (major.minor.patch)
- **Change Tracking**: Complete diff calculation between versions with Monaco diff editor
- **Version Metadata**: Creator, timestamps, and change notes
- **Rollback Capability**: Easy rollback to previous versions with confirmation
- **Approval Workflow**: Multi-stage approval process for script deployment
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Approver roles for version control governance

### Usage Examples

```php
// Create a new version
$version = $script->createVersion('Fixed performance issue', auth()->user());

// Submit version for approval
$version->submitForApproval(auth()->user());

// Approve version (requires approver role)
$version->approve(auth()->user(), 'Reviewed and approved');

// Reject version with reason
$version->reject(auth()->user(), 'Security concerns identified');

// Rollback to specific version
$script->rollbackToVersion($version->id);

// Compare versions with diff visualization
$diff = $version->getDiff($previousVersion);

// Get version history with approval status
$versions = $script->versions()->with('approvals')->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')->get();
```
